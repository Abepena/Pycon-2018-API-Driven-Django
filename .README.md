# API-Driven Django Pycon 2018 Notes

- Using **Django Rest Frame Work** (DRF)
- Fist set up a votes model to count the ayes and nays on a civic vote on a certain date/time

### Views
___________
- If following the django tutorial, you might use Generic Views.
- Generic Views are Class based views for Listing, Editing, and updating views.

To create a View that lists and creates Votes:

We need:
1. django.views.generic.list.ListView
2. django.views.generic.edit.CreateView
3. Template file
4. URL update
5. (Possibly) a ModelForm

### Rich front-end == client-first, API-Driven, API first

To create an APIView that lists and creates Votes

We need:
1. Model serializer for Vote
2. rest_framework.generics.ListCreateAPIView

### DRF ModelSerializers

What is it?
- Similar to Django Forms in the sense that they:
    - Take data from user, 
    - running through logic to save as data that the database understands
    - then save and update that model
- They also take the representation of the Model object and turn that into something that can be represented as JSON or HTML

Example:
```python
class AccountSerializer(selializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        """
        Meta signifies 'Account' is the model we want to
        operate on and the fields listed are the fields we want to expose
        """
        model = Account
        fields = ('id','account_name', 'users','created')
```

This is the pattern we want to be using to make a vote Serializer

make it in vote/serializers.py

you dont have to make migrations since you are not updating any models (the Vote model in this case)

### DRF ListCreatAPIView

Example:
```python
class UserList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
```
